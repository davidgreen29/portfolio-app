            Are you looking for someone to help build a new application with React or maintain an existing
             code base? Maybe you need help with responsive CSS styles. Well, look no further. Do you have 
             a NoSQL or relational database? I can help with that too. Have any other questions about how 
            I could help improve an application you're working on, feel free to contact me or view my work
