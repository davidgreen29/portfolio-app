            are you looking for someone to help build a new application with React or maintain an existing code base, 
            maybe you need help with responsive CSS styles, well look no further. Do you 
            have a NoSQL or relational database, I can help with that too. Have any other questions 
            about how I could help improve an application you're working on, feel free to contact me.
