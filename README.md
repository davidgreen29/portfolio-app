How I worked on this application 

I used Figma designs for the the main page design 
all code was written on VS code starting with create-react-app 
I created a server using node.js, express, and mongoose and deployed this with heroku 
finally I pushed the front end code to github and conected it with netlify

How to navigate

You can find all the CSS in my styles folder. Popup.css applies styles to the About modal and the Contact modal. 
You can find the rest of the styles in the app.css file. 

Navbar, about, and contact modal source code.
To view the source code for the navbar which contains the About and 
Contact components open the components folder 
and there you will find the navbar folder.

Popup component
The code for the popup modal is located inside the components folder. 

Main content and Footer component
Code for main content and footer is also located inside the components folder. 

My build choice logic 

For simplicity sake I wanted the app to be one page with a simple design so that the
users focus is on the content. I incorprated popup modals as way to display my 
about and contact info while maintaining a single page design. For this site I used 
plain CSS, no framework or library to showcase that I know how to 
create responsive designs without any help. I chose node.js to create the server because I have 
recently been improving my knowledge on this. I also used MongoDb as database to store contact info.
